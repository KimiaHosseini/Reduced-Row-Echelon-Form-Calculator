# Reduced-Row-Echelon-Form-Calculator

## Overview

This project is part of a linear algebra course (Fall 2023) taught by Dr. Ehsan Nazerfard. The main objective is to calculate the unknown currents in a given electrical circuit using linear algebra techniques, specifically through the application of the reduced row echelon form (RREF).

## Project Description

In this project, we will analyze an electrical circuit to find the unknown currents flowing through its wires. The circuit's nodes (A, B, C, D) adhere to Kirchhoff's current law, which states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving that node.

### Goals
    To derive the equations representing the currents at various nodes in the circuit.
    To construct an augmented matrix from these equations.
    To implement a function that reduces this augmented matrix to its reduced row echelon form (RREF).
